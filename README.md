# decodense
Decompose mean-field (HF/KS-DFT) results in terms of either atom-wise (``master``) or bond-wise (``bond_partition``) contributions to a molecular ground state energy or dipole moment.

A specific branch (``bond_partition``) is dedicated to calculations that decompose results by bonds:

``git switch bond_partition``

The repository consists of the following directories:

``decodense``: Source code

``examples``: Examples
